          <p class="aboutme"> Hey! Nice to finally meet you! My name is Tea Abuselidze. I am a sophomore at University of Missouri - Kansas City and am currently pursuing 
              my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My background includes back-end development, front-end development, UX/UI design, and most recently
              game development! I consider myself a "forever student" fueled by my passion of the vast world of tech and the need to diversify the tech industry.
              I am eager to build on both of my academic foundations of Computer Science and Information Technology and staying in tune with the latest digital
              updates.
